## What I learned ðŸ“š
I have alot of experience in conmputational biology but my experience with git/github as a creator/editor is limited. As such, I have found this very helpful. I know how to use github as a user: clone repositories, submit issues, etc. but I am keen to learn more on the dev side.

Thanks!
Joe
