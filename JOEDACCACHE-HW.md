## What I learned ðŸ“š
I have alot of experience in conmputational biology but my experience with git/github as a creator/editor is limited. As such, I have found this very helpful. I know how to use github as a user: clone repositories, submit issues, etc. but I am keen to learn more on the dev side.

Thanks!
Joe

## Wilson et. al. 
Computational reproducibility can be acheived in a variety of methods, some of my preffered practices mentioned by Wilson et. al. are:
* using R projects to contain all packages in compatible versions in a clonable and usable enviroment for others
* The above applies to git repositories as well: clonable and usable
* Tracking changes in scripts, retaining past versions and understanding when and who made what change
